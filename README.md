Automatic seismic salt interpretation with deep convolutional neural networks

This notebook contains sample Python codes to prepare input data and to construct / train convolutional neural networks for automatic seismic salt interpretation with Deep Convolutional Neural networks. The potential of CNN-based salt boy interpretation is demonstrated by using a state-of-art network structure U-Net, along with the residual learning framework ResNet, to delineate salt body with high precision.
